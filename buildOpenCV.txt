For training Haar Cascade some command line tool which works in opencv 3.x
It was broken in opencv 4.x therefore it is necessary to use opencv 3.x for training
(unless it has been fixed in version 4.x).
However after training has been finished (the result .xml file has been obrained), 
it is possible to use 4.x version again.

This script describes how to build certain version of opencv.

Installation opencv

System: WSL Ubuntu-18.04

# Install all dependecies
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y cmake g++ wget unzip
sudo apt install ffmpeg
sudo apt install pkgconf


# Install ffmpeg since opencv requires for build some libraries and packages like libavcodec etc. but not  contains them.
# To fix this install ffmpeg which is also quite common app used in linux e.g. for video processing.

mkdir PIA_Project
cd PIA_Project

wget -O opencv.zip https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/3.4.zip
unzip opencv

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../opencv-3.4
make
sudo apt install
